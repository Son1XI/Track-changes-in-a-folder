# Track-changes-in-a-folder

The program must track changes in the "check" folder, which located in the working directory. Creation, modification and deletion must be tracked. After starting program it waits for 60 seconds and displays information about the changes that have occurred in the monitored folder (with recursion).

Platform: win64
Development environment: Visual Studio

bugs:
Does not end on time correctly. Ends only when 60 seconds have passed and user do one more creation/modification/deletion
